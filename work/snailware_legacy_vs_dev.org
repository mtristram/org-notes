#+TITLE: SN@ilWare simulations : comparison between legacy and development branch

* Introduction

Since the switch to the new Cadfael/Bayeux/Falaise software suite, some time
latency has been found when simulating SuperNEMO events. For instance,
simulating 2\beta events on Lyon cluster was taking 20 minutes for 10 000 events
when it takes now more than 2 hours.

The purpose of this note is to investigate where the time processing is going by
comparing on a basic simulation setup the =legacy= code with the =trunk=
development branch.

* Installation of =legacy= branch

To install the =legacy= branch, we use the =aggregator= script file and its
latest [[ https://github.com/xgarrido/zsh-aggregator/commit/1b2ed677e83e3548fa6812c19f1e4240adbdf6a7][revision]] to get Cadfael legacy version.
